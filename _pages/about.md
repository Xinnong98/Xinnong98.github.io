I am a Ph.D. candidate in Pharmaceutical Sciences at University at Buffalo. I received my Master's degree in Pharmacometrics and Personalized Pharmacotherapy from University at Buffalo. I obtained Bachelor's degrees in Shengyang Pharmaceutical University.

My research background includes PopPK model development, machine learning application in pharmacometrics, as well as PBPK model buidling. Specifically, I made contribution to the pyDarwin toolbox development, developed PBPK model for the female reproductive tract, and participated in the long-acting injectable cabotegravir subproject.
