I'm a master student at Dr. Robert Bies Lab, University at Buffalo. My research interest is applying pharmacometric tools in solving the real-world problems. My current research focuses on estimating the HIV prevention of long-acting Cabotegravir using the population pharmacokinetic model. I'm also a self-motivated learner, keep trying all kinds of modeling and simulation methods.
