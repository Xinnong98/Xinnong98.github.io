---

### Description:

Bascially, this project is about estimating Cabotegravir long-acting concentration response for HIV prevention. 

Fro me, I

1. Calculated the number of days where the CAB concentration was above 8*PAIC90, 4*PAIC90, 1*PAIC90
2. Measured the 'area under the curve' for both cases and controls in this study 
3. Got absorption rate and elimination rate

Relative code and more info will be on Github soon.
