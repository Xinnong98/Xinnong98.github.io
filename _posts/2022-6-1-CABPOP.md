title: Estimating Cabotegravir Long-acting effect on HIV Prevention Using Population Pharmacokinetic Model
date: 2022-6-1
description: Population Pharmacokinetic Model Evaluation in Case-Control Study

### Description:

Bascially, this project is about estimating Cabotegravir long-acting concentration response for HIV prevention. 

For me, I

1. Calculated the number of days where the CAB concentration was above 8*PAIC90, 4*PAIC90, 1*PAIC90
2. Measured the 'area under the curve' for both cases and controls in this study 
3. Got absorption rate and elimination rate

More info will be on Github soon.
