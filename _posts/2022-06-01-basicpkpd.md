Description:

This post includes several basic PK/PD models and one PBPK model. Classic PK/PD model such as TMDD model, IDR model, tolerance model, slow reversible model, transduction model. etc... are incorporated in this exercise. All the PK/PD models were coded using ADAPT5, the PBPK model were coded in Magnolia. Both Fortran and Python languages were applied. 


the code can be found [here](https://github.com/Xinnong98/Basic-PK-PD-Model).
